## Project Overview

### Purpose and Goals

AlkGraph is an ESM TypeScript Node.js library for graph-based interfacing with AI Agents. The library provides a flexible and powerful graph-based structure for representing and manipulating AI agent interactions, enabling more sophisticated agent behaviors and interactions.

### High-Level Architecture

The project follows a modular architecture with the following key components:

- **Core Graph Components**: Fundamental graph structures (nodes, edges, graph)
- **Storage Adapters**: Pluggable storage backends (starting with LevelDB)
- **Algorithms**: Graph traversal and analysis algorithms
- **Visualization**: Optional components for graph visualization

### Technology Stack

- **Language**: TypeScript (ESM)
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Testing**: Vitest
- **Linting**: ESLint
- **Formatting**: Prettier
- **Storage**: LevelDB (initial implementation)

## Development Workflow

### GitHub Flow

The project follows a standard GitHub flow:

1. **Issues**: Features and bugs are tracked as GitHub issues
2. **Branches**: Each feature/fix is developed in a dedicated branch
   - Branch naming: `feature/feature-name` or `fix/bug-name`
3. **Pull Requests**: Code is submitted via pull requests
   - PRs must include a description of changes
   - PRs must reference the issue they address
4. **Code Review**: All PRs require code review
5. **Merge**: After approval and passing tests, code is merged to main

### Issue Management

#### Issue Templates

Issues should include:
- Clear title describing the feature/bug
- Detailed description
- Acceptance criteria
- Related components/files
- Priority label

#### Task Decomposition

Tasks should be broken down to be completable in 10-30 minutes by a mid-level developer:

1. **Feature Breakdown**:
   - Break large features into smaller, independent tasks
   - Each task should have a clear, specific outcome
   - Tasks should be sequenced to build upon each other

2. **Task Estimation Guidelines**:
   - Consider complexity, not just time
   - Factor in testing requirements
   - Include documentation time
   - Account for review and revisions

3. **Task Size Indicators**:
   - **Small (10-15 min)**: Simple changes, single function modifications
   - **Medium (15-20 min)**: Multiple related changes, new simple functions
   - **Large (20-30 min)**: Complex logic, multiple components

## Code Standards

### File and Function Size Limits

#### File Size Guidelines

- **Ideal file size**: 100-300 lines of code
- **Maximum file size**: 500 lines of code
- **Warning threshold**: 400+ lines of code

When a file exceeds these limits, consider:
- Breaking it into multiple files
- Extracting reusable components
- Creating utility functions

#### Function/Method Size Guidelines

- **Ideal function size**: 5-15 lines of code
- **Maximum function size**: 30 lines of code
- **Warning threshold**: 25+ lines of code

When a function exceeds these limits, consider:
- Breaking it into smaller functions
- Simplifying logic
- Using design patterns to reduce complexity

### TypeScript Guidelines

#### Type Safety

- Avoid using `any` type whenever possible
- Use explicit return types for functions
- Use interfaces for object shapes
- Use generics for reusable components
- Enable strict TypeScript checking in tsconfig.json

#### Interface Design

- Design interfaces for extensibility
- Use composition over inheritance
- Keep interfaces focused and cohesive
- Document interface contracts clearly

#### Code Style

- Use single quotes for strings
- Use tabs for indentation
- Follow Prettier defaults for other formatting
- Use PascalCase for classes and interfaces
- Use camelCase for variables and functions
- Use UPPER_CASE for constants

### Error Handling

#### Error Types

Create specific error classes for different error categories:
```typescript
export class GraphError extends Error {
  constructor(message: string) {
    super(message);
    this.name = 'GraphError';
  }
}

export class StorageAdapterError extends Error {
  constructor(message: string) {
    super(message);
    this.name = 'StorageAdapterError';
  }
}
```

#### Error Propagation

- Use async/await with try/catch for async operations
- Avoid swallowing errors
- Add context when re-throwing errors
- Log errors at appropriate levels

## Testing Standards

### Test-Driven Development Approach

The project follows a test-driven development (TDD) approach:

1. **Write Tests First**: Before implementing a feature, write tests that define the expected behavior
2. **Red-Green-Refactor**:
   - Red: Write a failing test
   - Green: Write the minimum code to make the test pass
   - Refactor: Improve the code while keeping tests passing
3. **Test Coverage**: Aim for high test coverage, especially for core functionality

### Test Coverage Requirements

- **Minimum overall coverage**: 80%
- **Core components**: 90%+ coverage
- **Utility functions**: 70%+ coverage
- **Critical paths**: 100% coverage

### Test Organization

#### Unit Tests

- Test individual functions and methods in isolation
- Mock dependencies
- Focus on behavior, not implementation details
- Name tests descriptively: `it('should do something when condition')`

#### Integration Tests

- Test interactions between components
- Test storage adapters with actual data
- Test graph operations end-to-end

#### Performance Tests

- Benchmark critical operations
- Test with large datasets
- Test batched operations specifically

### Test File Structure

- Tests should mirror the source file structure
- Test files should be named `*.test.ts`
- Group related tests with `describe` blocks
- Use `beforeEach` for common setup

## Documentation Standards

### Code Documentation

#### JSDoc Requirements

All public APIs should have JSDoc comments:

```typescript
/**
 * Adds a node to the graph
 * 
 * @param node - The node to add
 * @returns The added node
 * @throws {GraphError} If the node already exists and strict mode is enabled
 */
public addNode(node: Node): Node {
  // Implementation
}
```

#### Self-Documenting Code

- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Extract complex conditions into named variables
- Use enums for related constants
- Add comments for non-obvious logic

### API Documentation

- Document all public APIs
- Include examples for common use cases
- Document edge cases and error conditions
- Keep documentation in sync with code

### Architecture Documentation

- Maintain high-level architecture diagrams
- Document design decisions and trade-offs
- Update documentation when architecture changes

## Performance Considerations

### General Guidelines

- Optimize for readability and maintainability first
- Profile before optimizing
- Document performance characteristics
- Add performance tests for critical paths

### Batched Operations

Batched operations are a key performance consideration:

- Design APIs to support batched operations natively
- Implement transaction support in storage adapters
- Provide both synchronous and asynchronous batch APIs
- Include comprehensive error handling for partial batch failures

Example batch operation pattern:
```typescript
// Batch add nodes
async batchAddNodes(nodes: Node[]): Promise<Node[]> {
  // Implementation
}

// Batch add edges
async batchAddEdges(edges: Edge[]): Promise<Edge[]> {
  // Implementation
}
```

### Memory Management

- Avoid memory leaks in long-running operations
- Implement pagination for large result sets
- Use streams for processing large datasets
- Consider memory usage in storage adapters

## Security Best Practices

### Input Validation

- Validate all inputs, especially from external sources
- Use strong typing to prevent type-related vulnerabilities
- Sanitize data before storage or processing

### Dependency Management

- Regularly update dependencies
- Use dependency scanning tools
- Pin dependency versions for stability

### Code Security

- Avoid eval() and other dangerous functions
- Be cautious with dynamic imports
- Follow the principle of least privilege

## Storage Adapter Implementation

### Adapter Interface

All storage adapters must implement a common interface:

```typescript
interface GraphStorageAdapter {
  // Node operations
  getNode(id: string): Promise<Node | null>;
  saveNode(node: Node): Promise<Node>;
  deleteNode(id: string): Promise<boolean>;
  
  // Edge operations
  getEdge(id: string): Promise<Edge | null>;
  saveEdge(edge: Edge): Promise<Edge>;
  deleteEdge(id: string): Promise<boolean>;
  
  // Batch operations
  batchSaveNodes(nodes: Node[]): Promise<Node[]>;
  batchSaveEdges(edges: Edge[]): Promise<Edge[]>;
  
  // Query operations
  getConnectedNodes(nodeId: string): Promise<Node[]>;
  getEdgesBetween(sourceId: string, targetId: string): Promise<Edge[]>;
  
  // Lifecycle operations
  initialize(): Promise<void>;
  close(): Promise<void>;
}
```

### LevelDB Adapter Implementation

The initial storage adapter will use LevelDB:

- Use namespaced keys for different entity types
- Implement efficient batch operations
- Handle serialization/deserialization of graph objects
- Implement proper error handling and retries

### Testing Adapters

- Test with both small and large datasets
- Test edge cases (e.g., non-existent nodes)
- Test concurrent operations
- Test recovery from failures
