# Debug Memory

## Role Description

The Debug role is responsible for identifying, diagnosing, and resolving issues in the AlkGraph library. This includes developing testing strategies, implementing comprehensive test suites, debugging runtime errors, optimizing performance bottlenecks, and ensuring the overall reliability and stability of the codebase.

## Key Information

- AlkGraph uses Vitest for testing
- The project aims for 80% overall test coverage, with 90%+ for core components
- Error handling follows a structured approach with specific error classes
- Performance testing is critical, especially for storage operations
- Both unit tests and integration tests are required

## Recent Decisions

### [2025-05-10] Test Structure Implementation

Decided to implement a test structure that mirrors the source code structure:
- Each source file has a corresponding test file
- Tests are organized in the same directory structure as the source code
- Test files are named with the `.test.ts` suffix

**Rationale**: Mirroring the source code structure makes it easy to locate tests for specific components and ensures comprehensive test coverage.

### [2025-05-10] Error Handling Strategy

Implemented a structured error handling approach:
- Created specific error classes for different error categories
- Used async/await with try/catch for async operations
- Added context when re-throwing errors
- Implemented proper logging for errors

**Rationale**: A structured error handling approach makes it easier to diagnose issues, provides better error messages for users, and ensures consistent error handling throughout the codebase.

## Current State

### Component: Testing Framework

The testing framework has been set up with Vitest, but test coverage is minimal. The test structure has been defined to mirror the source code structure.

**Status**: Set up, needs expansion

### Component: Error Handling

The error handling strategy has been defined with specific error classes for different categories. Implementation is in progress.

**Status**: Partially implemented

### Component: Performance Testing

Performance testing has been planned but not implemented. This is critical for storage operations and batch processing.

**Status**: Planned, not implemented

### Component: Integration Testing

Integration testing has been planned to test interactions between components, especially with the storage adapter. Implementation is pending.

**Status**: Planned, not implemented

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### LevelDB Connection Issues

**Issue**: LevelDB connection failures, especially during concurrent operations.

**Solution**: 
- Implement connection pooling
- Add retry logic with exponential backoff
- Ensure proper cleanup of resources

#### Memory Leaks in Long-Running Operations

**Issue**: Memory usage grows over time during long-running operations.

**Solution**:
- Implement pagination for large result sets
- Use streams for processing large datasets
- Add memory monitoring and cleanup

#### Concurrency Conflicts

**Issue**: Data corruption or inconsistent state due to concurrent operations.

**Solution**:
- Implement proper locking mechanisms
- Use transactions for multi-step operations
- Add conflict detection and resolution strategies
