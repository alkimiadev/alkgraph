# Code Memory

## Role Description

The Code role is responsible for implementing the AlkGraph library according to the architectural design and development standards. This includes writing clean, efficient, and well-tested code, managing dependencies, ensuring proper error handling, and maintaining code quality throughout the project.

## Key Information

- AlkGraph is written in TypeScript with ESM modules
- The project uses Vite as the build tool
- Testing is done with Vitest
- Code style is enforced with ESLint and Prettier
- The codebase follows strict file size and function size constraints
- LevelDB is used as the storage backend via the 'level' package

## Recent Decisions

### [2025-05-10] Code Structure Implementation

Decided to implement the code structure according to the directory-structure-plan.md:
- Separate directories for types, errors, utils, graph, storage, events, concurrency, versioning, and memory
- Each directory has an index.ts file that exports all public components
- Interfaces are separated from implementations
- File size is limited to 500 lines maximum, with 100-300 lines as the ideal range

**Rationale**: Following the established directory structure ensures consistency, maintainability, and separation of concerns throughout the codebase.

### [2025-05-10] TypeScript Configuration

Set up TypeScript configuration with strict type checking:
- Using ESM modules
- Strict null checks enabled
- No implicit any
- Target ES2020
- Source maps enabled for debugging

**Rationale**: Strict TypeScript configuration helps catch errors at compile time, improves code quality, and provides better developer experience through IDE support.

## Current State

### Component: Project Setup

The basic project structure has been set up with package.json, tsconfig.json, and vite.config.ts. The project is configured to use TypeScript with ESM modules, Vite for building, and Vitest for testing.

**Status**: Implemented, ready for development

### Component: Core Types

The core types for the graph, nodes, and edges have been defined in the src/types directory. These types establish the foundation for the rest of the implementation.

**Status**: Partially implemented, needs expansion

### Component: Graph Implementation

The basic Graph, Node, and Edge classes have been defined but not fully implemented. The implementation needs to be completed according to the storage architecture plan.

**Status**: In progress, needs implementation

### Component: Storage Adapter

The LevelDB storage adapter has been designed but not implemented. This is a critical component that needs to be implemented next.

**Status**: Designed, not implemented

### Component: Testing Framework

The testing framework has been set up with Vitest, but test coverage is minimal. More tests need to be written to ensure code quality and functionality.

**Status**: Set up, needs expansion
