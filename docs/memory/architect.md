# Architect Memory

## Role Description

The Architect role is responsible for high-level design and architecture planning for the AlkGraph project. This includes making key architectural decisions, defining system boundaries, establishing design patterns, and ensuring the overall technical vision is maintained throughout development.

## Key Information

- AlkGraph is an ESM TypeScript Node.js library for graph-based interfacing with AI Agents
- The architecture follows a modular approach with clear separation of concerns
- LevelDB is used as the initial storage backend
- The system supports multiple graphs and sub-graphs
- Event-driven architecture is used for system integration

## Recent Decisions

### [2025-05-10] Initial Architecture Documentation

Created comprehensive documentation for the AlkGraph project:
- Defined the storage architecture with LevelDB as the backend
- Established a directory structure that enforces separation of concerns
- Set development standards including file size constraints and code style
- Designed an event system for integration between components

**Rationale**: A well-documented architecture provides a solid foundation for development, ensures consistency across the codebase, and makes onboarding new developers easier.

### [2025-05-10] Agent Memory System Implementation

Designed and implemented an agent memory system to help different roles maintain context between tasks:
- Created separate memory files for different roles (Architect, Code, Debug, Orchestrator)
- Established a common structure for memory files
- Set up automatic updates after each task
- Integrated with existing documentation through references

**Rationale**: The agent memory system improves continuity between tasks, reduces context loss, and helps maintain a coherent development approach across different sessions.

## Current State

### Component: Overall Architecture

The overall architecture has been defined in the storage-architecture-plan.md document. It follows a layered approach with clear separation between the graph service, storage manager, and storage adapter. The architecture is designed to be flexible, allowing for different storage backends to be implemented in the future.

**Status**: Designed, not yet implemented

### Component: Directory Structure

The directory structure has been defined in the directory-structure-plan.md document. It organizes code by feature, with separate directories for types, errors, utils, graph, storage, events, concurrency, versioning, and memory management.

**Status**: Designed, not yet implemented

### Component: Development Standards

Development standards have been established in the development-standards.md document. These include file size constraints, code style guidelines, error handling approaches, testing standards, and documentation requirements.

**Status**: Defined, ready for implementation

### Component: Agent Memory System

The agent memory system has been designed and is currently being implemented. It provides a structured way for different roles to maintain context between tasks.

**Status**: Implementation in progress
