/**
 * Placeholder for Transaction tests
 * 
 * Tests will verify:
 * - Getting transaction ID
 * - Getting transaction status
 * - Getting transaction isolation level
 * - Getting transaction start time and timeout
 * - Checking if transaction is active/committed/aborted
 * - Checking if transaction has timed out
 * - Beginning transactions
 * - Committing transactions
 * - Aborting transactions
 * - Adding operations to transactions
 * - Getting operations from transactions
 * - Getting operation count
 * - Clearing operations
 * - Acquiring and releasing locks
 * - Transaction isolation levels
 * - Transaction timeouts
 * - Optimistic vs. pessimistic concurrency
